This app searches for and displays GitHub user information. Thi app aims to teach all three aspects, development, design and testing, in React Native. This project is inspired by [this Frontend Mentor project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). This application was adapted and improved based on what ChatGPT generated. The prompts that were used to solicit the rough code base from ChatGPT include:

* build an app that searches for and displays GitHub user information using React Native
* improve the style of this app
